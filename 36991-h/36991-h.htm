<p class="dropcap">here was a clanging, brassy melody upon the air. For three-score years since York of
the Scarlet Coats died, and the tune "God Save the King" floated for the last time out
of tavern door and mansion window, the bells of

<span class="pagenum" style="text-indent:0em;"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

old St. Paul's had begun their ringing like this:</p>


<div class="imgright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/gs02.png" width="346" height="467" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Loud and full voiced at eight o'clock sends good cheer abroad," said the tottering
sexton. "Softer and softer, as folks turn into bed, and faint and sweet at midnight,
when our dear Lord rises with the dawn." Cheery bells full of hope&mdash;gentle chimes,
as if the holy mother were dreaming of her babe. Joyous, jingling, jangling bells!
Through the town their tones drifted, over the thousands of slate-colored roofs, now
insistent on the Broadway, now lessening a little in some long winding alley, and then
finally dying away on the bare Lispenard Meadows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>Vesey Street&mdash;the gentry street&mdash;heard them first. The bigwigs in the long
ago, with the help of Gracious George, built the church, and who had a better right than
their children to its voices. Calm and serene lay Vesey Street with its rows of leafing
elms. Over the dim confusion of architectural forms slipped the moonlight in silver
ribbons, seeming to make sport of the grave, smug faces of the antiquated domiciles.
Like a line of deserted dowagers waiting for some recalcitrant Sir Roger de Coverley,
they stood scowling at one another. No longer linkboys and running footmen stuck brave
lights into the well-painted extinguishers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>

at each doorstep. No longer fashion fluttered to their gates. The gallants who had been
wont to pass them with, "Lud! what a pretty house!" were most of them asleep now on the
green breast of mother England, forgetful of that wide thoroughfare, which had never
reckoned life without them.</p>

<p>Into the parlor of Knickerbocker House, dubbed Knickerbocker Mansion some years after
the bibulous Sir William Howe had laid down his sceptre as ruler of the town, the chorus
of bells crashed.</p>

<p>"What a dastardly noise!" cried Jonathan Knickerbocker, throwing his newspaper over
his head. "Can

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

this Easter time never be kept without an infernal bell bombilation? I shall call a
meeting of the vestry&mdash;that idiot Jenkins should be kept at home!"

The head of the Knickerbocker family turned irately in his chair and glared at his
daughters. Three timid pairs of blinking eyes were raised from short sacks in answer to
his challenge, then lowered again over the wool. The fourth and fairest daughter of the
house, seated on the walnut sofa in the bow-window, gave no heed to his vehemence but a
suppressed sigh. With a final snort the <em>Gazette</em> was picked up again. The Easter
melody was waning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The Knickerbocker parlor&mdash;not the state parlor, which had long been
closed&mdash;was a dismal place&mdash;so large that four candles and one Rumford lamp
made but a patch of brightness in the gloom.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

Most of the furniture was ponderous and ugly, with two or three alien little chairs that
looked as if they might once have belonged to some light-hearted lover of the Louis. On
the almost barren

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

chimney-piece stood a pair of tall nankeen beakers, sepulchrally reminiscent of buried
Chinese years. Along the walls hung a score of mediocre portraits, the handiwork of the
usurious limner John Watson and his compatriot Hessilius. Spans of sunlit days had
stolen every tinge of carmine from their immobile and woodeny faces, leaving them the
drab color of time, in keeping with the room.</p>

<div class="imgright" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/gs03.png" width="346" height="462" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Above the cornice, near the sofa where Patricia Knickerbocker sat, hung an empty
frame. The portrait it contained had been banished to the attic while her three eldest
sisters were still in Wellington pantalets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"The woman looks like a Jezebel," Jonathan had sputtered. "Och! that leering smile."
He tried to blot from his mind the stray leaves he knew of her story, and the disturbing
thought that she was of his blood. "She shall not remain with the likenesses of my
ancestors!" he had told his sisters, who were over from Goby House.</p>

<p>When this descendant of the Knickerbockers spoke of his progenitors he always held
his head a trifle more erect, and puffed out his pompous figure, though, strange to
relate, like many another worthy man of a later day having the same foible, he knew very
little about

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

them. Of course he could have told you that the lady over the east bookcase, wearing a
blue tucker and holding a spray of milk-weed in her hand, was his Aunt Jane; and that
his father was a noted New York judge, the pride of three circuits. Or if his digression
were extended, there was his trump card, one of the first American Knickerbockers,
labelled "The Friend of Lord Cornbury!" These were the firmest rocks in his family
history, to which he could climb in safety, thence to look down with scorn on those
unfortunates beneath his social eminence. He was a Knickerbocker, of Knickerbocker
Mansion,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

Vesey Street, and a member of one of the oldest families in York and America.</p>

<p>Patricia, smiling little Patricia, rummaging one day among the dust-bins under the
eaves, had found the banished portrait. Juma, the gray-wooled negro, a comparatively new
member of the Knickerbocker household, who had appointed himself her body-servant ever
since his arrival at the mansion, was with her.</p>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/gs04.png" width="200" height="186" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>A faithful slave to old Miss Johnstone of Crown Street, Juma had been forced by his
mistress's death into new service. He was a picture of ebonized urbanity, a good
specimen of the vanished race

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

of Gotham blacks, gentler in manners and clearer in speech than their Southern cousins.
In his youth he had been sent to one Jean Toussaint of Elizabethtown to learn the art of
hair-dressing. He could impart much knowledge of wigs to a wigless age, and talked in a
grandiloquent fashion of Spencers, Albemarles, and Lavants. Many a beau peruke and
macaroni toupee his lithe fingers curled and sprinkled with sweet flower-water. The
voices of the fine people who were his visitors made constant music in his memory, and
his tongue was ever ready with anecdotes

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

of wizened beauties and uncrowned cavaliers.</p>

<p>Juma was faithful to the period of his greatest splendor. Deep in his heart he
despised the home to which freedom and poverty had led him after the demise of his
protectress. "Gold braid on company coat and silk stockings done ravel out in dese days.
Knickerbockers talk quality, but dey ain't got quality mannahs&mdash;Missy Patsy is de
only one of dem with tone."</p>

<p>He loved to listen to the girl as she tripped through the great rooms, humming softly
some air from Lennet's "London Song-Book"&mdash;one of the relics of his "ole Miss."
Patricia always sang

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

on the days when her sisters were visiting their aunts on the bluff. Juma loved her, and
during his five years' residence in the family had many times taken her youthful mind in
train with quaint eighteenth-century maxims and fetiches.</p>

<p>"De wise miss drop her fan when she enters de ballroom," he would say. "Den she gets
de men on der knees from de start."</p>

<p>"I wish I were invited to balls," Patricia sighed. "The Kings and Grahams give one or
two every year, but father never notices them."</p>

<p>"Well, you jes' know how to behave," he chuckled. "Doan' yo'

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>

forget de tricks your Uncle Juma taught yo'."</p>

<p>When the two had met in the attic that April day, Juma's spirits were as ebullient as
usual.</p>

<p>"How lovely she is, Juma! See, there is a blush on each cheek. Her pink brocade makes
me think of a rose dancing in the wind."</p>

<p>Patricia stared into the canvas face before her and the lips seemed to curve
themselves into the shadow of a smile. "I know you were the fairest one of us," she
whispered, "the fairest and the best."</p>

<p>"Dat's the real quality way of holding the head," vouchsafed Juma. "I'se pow'ful
'clined to think she looks like yo', missy." And

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

then they had laughed, shut away with maimed chairs, tired spinets, and other voiceless
things, glad to have escaped from Knickerbocker frowns.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 392px;">

<span class="caption">"<em>How lovely she is, Juma!</em>"</span>
</div>

<p>It was a dismal household, that of the old mansion&mdash;the master absorbed in his
passion for wealth and worship of family; the three eldest daughters, who might once
have had some individuality but now were moulded in the form of their father. "Callow
old maids," any individual of the lower ranks of York would have dubbed them. They wore
little bunches of sedate curls over each ear, and dressed in sombre, genteel colors
proper to their exalted rank. On the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>

first day of the week they dozed through a long sermon; on its last day they simpered
politely at the Whist Club. Fears of broken jelly-moulds or of the romping Patricia's
next prank were the only disturbers of the tranquillity of their lives. Jonathan
Knickerbocker was their one Almighty Mirror. When he labelled Mrs. Scruggins, the
draper's niece, a person not fit to associate with, their stiff gowns obediently gave
forth hisses at the said lady. When he prated of his father's shrewdness, they nodded
discreet approval; and at the mere mention of the loyal friend of Lord Cornbury, they
bobbed like grass before a gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Patricia's impressionable temperament was saved by Juma's advent from the sirocco of
dulness that wafted her sisters over the lake of years. His "ole Miss," a looker on at
the "Court of Florizel," had unconsciously taught him to imbibe the atmosphere
surrounding the Graces. A democracy could not spoil her elegance, for Chesterfield's
warning was ever before her eyes. She who copied the footsteps of Baccelli, adored her
Sterne and Beattie, and though her eyes grew dim, never let romance pass her window
unmolested, had left her impress upon the mind of the faithful servitor. Life to him was
a gay-colored picture-book, brighter

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>

perhaps because he could not read the printed page. All his maids were cherry-ribboned
and belaced; all his roystering sparks clinked gilded canakins. Love was ever smiling on
them! For wellnigh half a century he had listened to tales of the gay god as he bound
one romance-loving woman's silken tresses. Small wonder that he thought the urchin ruled
the world!</p>

<hr style="width:10%" />

<p>When the bells rested their brassy throats for the first time that night, and
Jonathan Knickerbocker could take up his West Indies accounts undisturbed, giving his
daughters freedom to doze in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>

peace, "Miss Patsy" stole on tiptoe from the room. She wanted to be alone. Juma, ambling
through the dim hall to his pantry, caught sight of her fluttering garments, but did not
speak. Only an hour or two before, he had placed in the chamber where she slept a bunch
of arbutus which young Sheridan, the organist, had given into his keeping. The wild,
sweet-scented flower grew in but one spot near the town&mdash;an island in the centre of
the Woodbridge Swamp, where Captain Kidd in a freak of fancy had planted it over the
body of a comrade, tradition said, and no one ever disputed the story. To reach it, even
the most sure-footed ran

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>

the danger of being caught in the bog.</p>

<p>Patricia wondered as she mounted the stairs how her lover had been able to come with
her gift unseen. The watching negro smiled sadly and shook his head when the last bit of
her garment disappeared over the staircase like a white moth moving treeward.</p>

<p>Oh, how terrible it was never to see him in her father's house! Never to have seen
him alone, only that one time, after twilight service, when she had stolen a meeting at
the Battery, while her family were taking their Sabbath-day ride up the Bowery Road!</p>

<p>The old vehicle held but six,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>

and as the aunts always rode home with their brother, Patricia was left to the escort of
Juma, custodian of the prayer-books. By the clump of protecting boxwood at the end of
the Marine Parade she had come upon him. The sea held his eyes until there was no
mistaking the footsteps. Her approaching crinoline made soft little rustles, as if
entreating him to leave his musings. Her body-guard's shuffles, too, were unmistakable.
Like some young potentate her lover turned about, describing an elaborate bow with his
white castor. The very picture of starched tranquillity he looked, but underneath the
blue hammer-tail coat a heart was beating

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>

wildly, as she, made wise by love, knew well&mdash;for her own was its echo.</p>

<p>There was a brief moment while she watched the color mount to his sun-bronzed face,
the blue eyes glow, the strong form quiver ever so slightly. Then her lips framed
"Richard"&mdash;the key of the universe. "Patricia!" came the answer.</p>

<p>Juma, from his discreet distance, heard her compared to the magnolia worn on the
lapel of the coat she admired so much. In her white and fragrant young womanhood she was
like it from sheer inaccessibility. The flower expressed her character and
position&mdash;Patricia Knickerbocker, a daughter of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

autocrat of York. When he mentioned her father's name the girl shivered. An invisible
wall seemed to rise between them. Then the feeling died away. Her soul grew wider awake
each moment her lover gazed at her.</p>

<p>As he drew her closer to him Juma's figure in the background bent over a flower in
the path.</p>

<p>"Let 'em kiss," he mumbled. "Ole Miss used to say de female dat never lub am a sour
pippin, and dere's enough ter start a vinegar press in dis family."</p>

<p>"You'll not permit them to take you away from me? You will be mine forever and ever?"
said the youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>A sigh of happiness answered him.</p>

<p>"I know I'm poor, Patricia, and my family can never equal yours."</p>

<p>"Don't!" she whispered. "What does it matter, what does anything matter&mdash;only
that I'm here <em>with you</em>!"</p>

<p>"See the night creeping in off there, dear heart. It holds nothing more wonderful
than this moment."</p>

<p>"How black the water looks," she faltered.</p>

<p>"I will go to your father and demand your hand." She was trembling.</p>

<p>"You do not know what a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

Knickerbocker is&mdash;an awful creature with a hundred gorgon heads constantly leering
and preaching; detecting flaws in other people's families. One head will tell you that
you play the organ in St. Paul's, and another may see that your coat is a trifle worn.
We're not the only clan of them in the land."</p>

<p>"We must not fear them&mdash;not to-night, when love is filling the world."</p>

<p>"Only one of my grandmothers married for love, and she was thought to be
disgraced."</p>

<p>"You will follow her?" he asked, a catch in his voice.</p>

<p>Juma was signalling for them to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>

part, and on his forehead she kissed "I will!"</p>

<p>Now alone on the dark staircase she meditated on his words. When that malignant
crone, Gossip, started on her round, what would happen?</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice of her father adding up the indigo cargo fell upon her ears. He
would end their happiness; a man powerful enough to kill the spirit of Easter in his
home could do anything. Creeping through the narrow passage she came to the great north
balcony window. There she paused and raised her eyes to the dome of the night. Long
lines of stars were strung across the meadows of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>

heaven. The dials of the world seemed suddenly stilled. Below the infinite peace a
budding landscape sloped gently into a placid sea. Myriads of little lights in humble
cots blinked an answer to the fires above. Leaning on the broad window-seat of blackened
Jersey oak she tried to descry his dwelling, but the tree-tops shut it away.</p>

<p>A few hours before, he had asked her to be his wife, and she, a Knickerbocker, had
thrilled at his words. Like a tide the memory of his love swept back to her. Then on its

second David might fail to force them. All her dreams were fantasies, with no bearing
upon reality. All her hopes were sunbeams vanquished by one dark shadow. To her
distorted imagination her family seemed accursed. Every face bore some mark of it, even
the row of dim portraits in the room below. But, ah! there was one, a face turned to the
rafters of the attic, whose bright eyes and red lips knew love untinctured by the dross
of the world. In the darkness it rose before her strangely insistent. As in a
time-blurred mirror she looked and saw herself, and the feeling, though uncanny, gave
her a sense of comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>A wind began to sigh in the garden. Through the boxwood maze and barren urns it swept
Smiling Flora, sleeping Endymion, and all the fabulous court that had stood there years
before the coming of the Knickerbockers grew more humanly colored as the moon passed
behind a cloud. Since York had become a queenly city and the wonder of the western
world, mute and peacefully passive they had watched the seasons come and go. Countless
lovers must have known them. She saw back into the springs, the flower times. Sedan
chairs and swaying post-chaises had borne these dainty lovers all away. Oh, strange,
sweet thought! She,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>

too, would have to go&mdash;with him.</p>

<p>Down by the pale and shivering elms the iron bar of the gate clicked. Dark figures
were entering the garden. The gods and goddesses faded before her eyes. No one visited
them on Easter eve. Her father did not keep the season.</p>

<p>She steadied her knees on the slippery seat. The spray of arbutus she was wearing
over her heart cut her hands as she pressed closer to the pane.</p>

<p>"My aunts! they know!" she whispered to herself.</p>

<p>Terror of her father&mdash;of them all&mdash;swept over her, chilling the very
recesses of her being. As the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>

habiliments of her august relatives became more distinct, she grew calmer. With slow and
measured tread they walked, while to their right minced Betty, a small abigail, swaying
a lantern.</p>

<p>"It is the march of pride coming to crush me!" she cried.</p>

<p>Then the bells began to peal again&mdash;"Pride&mdash;pride" they seemed to mock.
"Love must die for pride!"</p>

<p class="dropcap">n the wreck of many social thrones&mdash;for the town named after the Duke of York
passed through numerous transitions the world knows nothing of&mdash;Patricia's aunt,
Miss Georgina Knickerbocker, had elected to raise her sceptre. "I rule by right" was her

<span class="pagenum" style="text-indent:0em;"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>

dictum. "My family is
old; few families are older or more aristocratic. The famous Judge Josiah Knickerbocker
was my father, and my brother Jonathan owns Knickerbocker Mansion, the finest dwelling
in York."</p>

<p>No potentate ever wore a crown more blissfully than Miss Georgina. Tall, beak-nosed,
gruff-voiced she was, always with her younger sister, Miss Julie, in tow and under good
control&mdash;Miss Julie, who smirked and copied her when family pride was concerned,
though she had her own misgivings and opinions on other matters. Miss Julie even had
emotions and sentimentalities of her own, which she struggled to keep bottled up before

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>

her relatives and the world, uncovering them only in secret, as she did her jasmine
scent and pomatum pot.</p>

<p>The little woman's real name was Jerusalem, bestowed upon her at a time when the
judge her father's religious spirit was in its blossoming period. One great grief of her
life was that she had given way to wickedness and changed this outlandish cognomen. She
often brought the subject up before Dr. Slumnus, as he stopped in for a social game of
chess. "Indeed, Miss Julie," he would answer soothingly, "the name is so Christian that
it sounds heathenish. No well-conducted female should presume

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>

to bear the name of the holy city. Nay, ma'am, it would have come perilously near
sacrilege to retain it!"</p>

<p>Thus assured, Miss Julie would give herself over to the excitement of endeavoring to
queen a pawn. Later, in her chamber, ready to blow out her candle, alone with the crowd
of memories waiting to conduct her to the land of dreams, she shuddered. Her father's
stern eyes would glare at her reproachfully; sometimes she would try to mock at them,
remembering the words of Dr. Slumnus&mdash;but oftener a tear or two trickled down her
faded cheeks and stained the strings of her nightcap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Together these two elderly Knickerbockers were unweary in their efforts to interpret
high life to their circle. Their family pride was more expansive than their brother
Jonathan's. He talked chiefly of his Aunt Jane, the milk-weed lady, of his renowned
father, and of that dim shade of a Knickerbocker who was the friend of Lord Cornbury.
Miss Georgina had climbed higher into her hereditary tree. She prated of a great-uncle
who married a niece of Lord Campbell&mdash;a cousin underscored in her records as Laird
of Barula&mdash;the grand Makemies, the high-stepping Gabies, and the learned Gobies.
And, as for Aunt

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>

Jane, why, she was dowered with a larger chest of silver than any Jersey woman of her
day. Those records of her paduasoys and alamodes would have sickened a Custis; and her
love-affairs!&mdash;the wench herself might have been astounded at hearing that she once
refused a patroon of Rensselaerswyck and a president of the College of New Jersey.</p>

<p>Quietly Miss Julie would sit and listen to her sister, but, once away from her, she
would assume what she believed to be the Almack manner, call imagination to her aid, and
discourse to her long-suffering acquaintance. Aunt Jane's chest of plate became a
veritable crown

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>

furgeon laden with tasters, posset cups, punch-bowls, muffineers, and salvers of
priceless and unique patterns. Her gowns would have done credit to a Drury Lane queen.
The patroon of Rensselaerswyck drank a flask of camphor to forget his Jane. Scores of
suitors died of lacerated hearts for her dear sake, and the president of the College of
New Jersey vowed he could not hear the word love spoken in his presence, not even in his
young gentlemen's conjugations.</p>

<p>It was the arrival, from the vulgarian camp of Trenton, of one Mrs. Snograss that
first brought interference with the sway of these

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

gentle ladies. That year, in which Richard Sheridan first played the organ in St. Paul's
and Mrs. Snograss elected to reside in York, proved, indeed, an eventful one for the
community. The genteel portion of Gotham society, like the family of the Vicar of
Wakefield, was wont to lead a peaceful life. Most of its adventures befell it by its own
fireside, or consisted of migrations from the blue bed to the brown. Or there was the
yearly glimpse of the Branch, or Schooley's Mountain, and on rare occasions venturesome
parents took their offspring to Hobuck for a fortnight&mdash;especially if they were
marriageable daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>The Misses Knickerbocker had visited the latter place in its transition period. There
Georgina purchased her Davenport tea-service for a song, and was fond of telling of the
fact. And Julie treasured a sweeter memory of the green Elysium&mdash;a dried-up flower
of memory, but once a rose, nevertheless, carefully guarded from the world, hidden
indeed from herself most of the time.</p>

<p>No one knew exactly how it began&mdash;that social war over the two capitals of
Trenton and York. Black "Rushingbeau," the York pronunciation for Mrs. Snograss's
serving-man, Rochambeau, meeting Juma at the morning market in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

centre of the green, had dubbed the Knickerbocker chickens "spinkle-shanked fowls."</p>

<p>"Wot you know 'bout hens in yo' small 'count town!" retorted the loyal champion of
York. Like a mushroom the story grew, and spread from Vesey Street kitchens into
sitting-rooms and parlors. Of course the aspersive attitude toward York was that of Mrs.
Snograss reflected in Rochambeau.</p>

<p>"To think that a resident of Trenton, a city named after a mere merchant, should have
the effrontery to speak disparagingly of our ancient capital!" cried Mrs. Rumbell,
mother-in-law of Dr. Slumnus. "These are degenerate times,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>

alack! What would poor Roberta Johnstone say if she were here? Let me see how many royal
governors have lived amongst us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rumbell counted on her slim, old fingers. The Knickerbocker ladies, who lacked
the Rumbell knowledge of their city's past, brought all their brightest family banners
to the fray.</p>

<p>"Lud," said Miss Georgina, and Miss Julie promptly echoed her, "I have never even
visited the spot where the Snograss woman came from; I know that the Comte de
Survilliers, or plain Mr. Bonaparte, as he prefers to be called, when he failed to
secure Knickerbocker Mansion for a residence

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

decided to repair thither. Poor man, he must have languished!" she added with a final
snort.</p>

<p>"And he was such a showy man too!" sighed her sister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Snograss, learning of the ferment her servant had aroused, sagaciously remarked:
"Let them talk; their chatter is a lecture to the wise; as for capitals, everybody
knows, counting out the inhabitants of this mud-hole, that Trenton came near being the
capital of the whole country!"</p>

<p>When this bombastic statement was hurled at Vesey Street, it made as much of a
sensation as the late news from Cherubusco. Most

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>

of the Government officers were classed with the Snograss widow by the affronted
Gothamites, and Mrs. Rumbell said openly that if she had her life to live over England
should have welcomed her when the cross of St. George was torn down from the courthouse
flag-staff.</p>

<p>The winter died and still there was no cessation of hostilities. The choir-room of
St. Paul's, where the ladies of the Bengal mission met and listened to itinerant
lecturers, or sewed garments for the needy, was the usual field for battle. When Mrs.
Snograss arrived late one day for Mr. Timbuckey's talk on the piety of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

George Crabbe, she was unfortunately ushered to Miss Georgina Knickerbocker's bench.
That haughty lady, the enemy being comfortably ensconced, arose and stalked over to Mrs.
Rumbell's seat, followed by her sister and the Mansion girls, so that the bustle ensuing
spoke to everybody of what was taking place. Patricia smiled a mortified, half-sad smile
at Mrs. Snograss, but the Trentonian only accepted it as additional insult.</p>

<p>A month later Mrs. Rumbell fainted when her sewing-chair was placed by the disturber
of her peace. She was one of the most violent in her aversion to the newcomer.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>

The Rev. Samuel Slumnus shook his fat finger at his mother-in-law, as the crafty
dowager, enjoying the excitement created by her feigned swoon, could see with her eyes
half-opened. Such conduct was not to be borne. "Rebellion in my own family," fumed the
perplexed dominie. "I must put a stop to it at once." In his agitation he clasped and
unclasped his hands and caressed his sparse locks. When a hush fell at last upon the
room, he was seen mounting the choir-platform.</p>

<p>"The meeting of the Easter Guild will be held this year at the residence of Mrs.
Snograss," he sputtered. For a full minute silence

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>

reigned&mdash;then came a clangor of tongues. "He is almost as red in the face as if he
choked on the prune-pits in the Knickerbocker fruit-cake," some irreverent one
whispered. It was said afterward that Mrs. Snograss had put a five-dollar bill in the
mission-box as she left the choir-room that morning&mdash;a performance not without
effect. A few parishioners were even heard to lament the fact that Dr. Slumnus's family
was not of the same standing as his wife's. Miss Georgina declared privately to her
sister that any one who went to the Snograss woman's should never darken the door of
Goby House again. But when the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>

day preceding Easter came, and she heard from Julie of the delight the town was taking
in the prospect of viewing the much-talked of Snograss interior, one venturesome
housekeeper having even asserted that she intended going up to the chambers, Miss
Georgina, wild with jealousy, decided to carry the war into the enemy's country.</p>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 330px;">

</div>

<p>As the night before that day of days died away and clarion cocks made the young dawn
vocal, eager hands drew back the curtains of four-posters. Above the green-gray of
spring-time streets and lanes, the sentinel tree-tops pointed to the translucent blue of
a smiling

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>

sky. "Day's fair and all's well!" bawled the watch as they blew out their smoking
lights. Voices cracked and rusted by sleep echoed the cry in the depths of soft,
chintz-bound coverlets. "My best ferrandine coat," mumbled Miss Georgina to herself, in
her delight over a pleasing picture of her entrance into the Snograss parlor. She let
the bolster slip to the floor and precipitated her head against the carved laurel leaves
of the top-board, all unconsciously. Bright

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>

were the visions of cherished falafals and gewgaws that came to the members of the
Easter Guild as they parted company with Morpheus.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rumbell, looking from a casement in the rectory, felt the sweetness of the
season fall upon her. That patch of fresh sky, suggestive of new life and a swift-footed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>

May, was more to her than a volley of sermons. The snow still lay on hill and heath.
Father Winter, neglectful of one of his worlds, was sporting among the northern
mountains. Oh, the peace of it! Why should she care if the wealthy Mrs. Snograss had
come to York with her Trenton innovations? All her past grievances were forgotten. In
her blissful state she felt she could even go the length of sewing whalebone in her
second-best silk skirt to conform to the ridiculous fashion of stiffened skirts,
introduced by that lady. Everything was changing! What could she, frail and old, gain by
wrestling with the times?

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>

Across the way, torn landscape shades blinded the windows of Johnstone House. Roberta
was dead and her home awaited a new tenant. Beyond lay the Bowling Green, the background
of her long life&mdash;witness to all the parts the stage-master, Fate, had dealt out to
her. Joys and sorrows marked its worn paths. The city of her golden time was fading
away. No halloos of eager huntsmen, ushering in Aurora, greeted her ears as of yore.
Only a stray thrush, mistaking the season, trilled liquid notes to his lost mates on a
hemlock by her chamber.</p>

<p>Soon the daylight's eyes were wide open, and the door-knockers,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>

across the church-yard, began to glow like miniature suns. Festivals and holidays always
brought the housekeepers of York to market, followed by their faithful blacks carrying
little wicker baskets. They tripped first to Mrs. Sykes's booth, where one could find
all the season's delicacies; then to the wintergreen-berry man, and on through the
circle of venders. The mystical joy of Eastertide that flooded the heart of Mrs. Rumbell
in the dawn swept through the concourse at the market. The perfume of the southern
lilies, the merry cries of hucksters, and the shrill calls of gutter-waifs as they
tugged at the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

skirts of Cock-a-nee-nae Bess were all permeated with it.</p>

<p>The prattling groups about Mrs. Sykes ofttimes broke away to take sly looks across
the green at the distant Broadway. "Will she come?" "Shall we extend our hands to her,
or just curtesy?" These and many like questions went for naught that morning. The blinds
of Snograss house were parted; a turbaned negress came out and washed the entry. Once
the opening of a door thrilled the curious dames. But the newcomer was waiting to enjoy
her full triumph in the afternoon.</p>

<p>No one looked toward the house on Vesey Street. The Knickerbockers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>

never frequented the market&mdash;Jonathan Knickerbocker forbade his family's
participation in such vulgar customs.</p>

<p>Georgina did not descend to her sitting-room in as pleasant a humor as was to have
been expected from her waking contemplations. She jangled her keys so ominously as she
strutted through the halls and pantries that Julie was afraid to venture out. On the day
before Easter the little woman was in the habit of stealing away to a by-lane near the
market. From a discreet distance she directed her purchases. Children would run for her
oranges, the cock-a-nee-nae necessary to her happiness, the boxes of Poppleton

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

sweets and foreign nuts. When they were very swift she would reward them with as much as
a dime apiece, so great was the delight she felt in providing a secret store of
goodies.</p>

<p>To-day there was no escaping. The market was sold out and the booths carried away
before she finished helping her sister tie up the Easter presents. It was a custom among
the ladies of York to exchange chaste and useful gifts of their own handiwork. Worsted
hat-bag covers and silk mittens were the favorites. Mrs. Rumbell was the one exception
to the rule. She still cut up her father's brocade vests into small squares, which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>

she filled with dried rose-geranium leaves and distributed among her acquaintance. Three
generations had received these fragrant marks of her regard, and the wits accused her
relative of having been a Hollander, addicted to the habit of swarthing himself in
superfluous garments. Members of the Scruggins set went further, and hinted maliciously
that he was a dealer in old clothes.</p>

<p>Miss Georgina preferred silk mittens, and gave and received no less than a dozen
pairs a season. If the ones sent to her were of a color she did not like, she kept them
for a year or two, and then packed them off again. This was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>

quite permissible in York. On one occasion Georgina's own mittens were returned to her,
but far from being angry, she smiled a grim welcome at them, and remarked to her
household that she was glad to see them back for they were at least fashioned of pure
silk, and that was more than she could say of many pairs that had been sent to her.</p>

<p>Quaint little ladies of Gothamtown&mdash;quaint little old-time
figures!&mdash;flitting in and out of your ancient homes like shadows!&mdash;who cares
to-day for your petty gifts, your plans, and jealousies? Only one or two remember you.
The walks you trod are vanishing, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>

water-front gardens where you smiled and languished at sedate gentlemen are mostly
hidden 'neath bricks and mortar, and the very buildings you were born in, that stood so
long impervious to the rude hands of progress, are being demolished. Those musty
garments of Juma's "ole Miss," the friend of Mrs. Rumbell, are now folded in some attic
trunk with your own pet vanities. What would the haughty Miss Georgina have said if she
could have gazed through the door of the future and seen a Scruggins brat grown into a
leader of fashion and carrying her own tortoise fan&mdash;sold with other Knickerbocker
effects at the last vendue?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>If one had loitered in Vesey Street that afternoon before Easter so many years past,
one would, no doubt, have joined the stragglers about the gates of Snograss House, and
watched the members of St.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

Paul's Easter Guild mince up Broadway, carefully keeping to the pave. The Flying Swan
from Elizabethtown was due at four o'clock, and those timid ladies of the long ago knew
that the swaying, swaggering bedlam of a coach would enjoy spattering them as it rattled
up to the City Hotel. On the porch of that fine hostelry, where Mr. Clarke once wooed
his muse and scores of thirsty throats the wine-cup, stood the host, Davy Juniper, whose
very name was synonymous with cheer. Through the half-opened door came loud gusts of
unceremonious laughter as the portly innkeeper, curveting on tiptoe, swung his garland
of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

Easter green over the sign-board. Davy's eyes were riveted on the flashing colors of
feminine gear across the street. Now Mrs. Rumbell tottered by and bobbed to him; now a
bevy of the Scruggins set passed the house opposite, and gazed in, like forbidden Peris
at the door of Paradise. Sometimes the street was covered with pedestrians. The quality
abroad affected the good man's spirits. He began to pipe some merry verses from a
tap-room ditty:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">

<p>The night was creeping on, clear and cold, and there would be full settles about his
waggish fires. In the sky, puffs of fleecy clouds were hurrying away like sheep eager to
reach the fold of mother-dusk. Off in the west, where twilight parted her curtains,
glowed faint streaks of yellow and rose color, promises of daffodil meadows and
flower-strewn lands to come.</p>

<p>He was turning for a parting
survey of the street when his ears
caught the tremulous motion of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>

some vehicle. Dashing out of Vesey Street came the Knickerbocker chariot, creaking
protestations as it swung up to the Snograss stile.</p>

<p>Out popped Miss Georgina, followed by her sister. Never had Miss Georgina seemed so
like a man-of-war's man in a flounce. Miss Julie shrunk into insignificance beside her.
Tavern maids, attracted by the noise and heedless of the cold, poked their heads out of
dormer windows. The passengers on the Flying Swan just turning the pike slipped
cautiously from the seats behind the guard to find out the cause of the excitement.
Juma, hurrying home to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

the mansion, paused for a moment to see the sisters of his master step down.
"Ramrods&mdash;old Ramrods," jeered Mr. Juniper, as he flung a last defiant "tol, de
rol," at the gaping street.</p>

<p>The door of the tavern had no more than swung to when that of Snograss House opened.
Every inmate of the room eyed Miss Georgina as she greeted the mistress. There was an
element of hostility in their ceremonious handshake. As the sister of the autocrat of
York viewed the rich furnishings of the apartment, the gold-legged piano and the
silk-covered furniture, her lips straightened into a sinister line. Her own possessions

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

shrunk into insignificance compared with this elegance. Even the long shut-up state
parlor in Knickerbocker Mansion could hardly vie with it. Lady Tyron, the last lady of
York, had fitted that room with heirlooms from her English home. Jonathan was in the
habit of calling it the finest apartment in the State. He prated of its mouldering
beauties often, forgetting that it was lauded by his townsmen long before the
Knickerbockers entered its portals.</p>

<p>The contents of the Snograss parlor had given other Gothamites momentary uneasiness
that afternoon. Of course no one felt they possessed the Knickerbocker right

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

to feel deeply aggrieved over them. Mrs. Rumbell, spying the oil-painted views of
Trenton by the entrance door, hurriedly shut her eyes, vowing the calm feeling in her
heart should not be disturbed. As penance for the pain which the pictures of the hated
capital gave her she seized a dish of quince scones and ran with them to Dr. Slumnus.
Refreshments had not been passed about, and the rector of St. Paul's signalled to his
mother-in-law not to approach. Thinking that he preferred the gooseberry tarts on an

chair and took refuge in the hall.</p>

<p>If any one had imagined that Mrs. Snograss would forgive the various slights put upon
her in York, she or he was doomed to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>

disappointment. All the pleasant things they said to her about her costly egg-shell
china, the glass aviary with the artificial tree, and other luxuries, failed to soften
her vindictive mood. Each timidly expressed compliment recalled to her a covert sneer, a
deprecating smile, or a garment hastily drawn aside. As Miss Georgina, on behalf of the
presiding committee, counted up the Easter gifts the church would give to the poor, the
Trenton widow whom she feared as a rival was musing on past insults.</p>

<p>"Ten tin trumpets," called the loud voice.</p>

<p>"I can humble her," thought the Snograss woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ten surprise packages," continued the other.</p>

<p>"I'll give the Knickerbocker family a surprise," spoke the indignant Trentonian half
aloud.</p>

<p>She was naturally an amiable person, but the aristocratic congregation of St. Paul's
had impaired her temper, proffering her vinegar when she had sought the wine of
good-fellowship. She stared at the bedizened figure of the sister of the autocrat of
York a moment longer, then turned meaningly to the only member of the Scruggins set who
happened to be present. There was already a look of triumph in her eyes. "She shall bend
to the dust soon," she whispered.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>

Then she arose from her sofa, clashing the folds of her tilter until the room was full
of lustring mockery. Everything was in readiness for Mrs. Snograss's climax of the
afternoon. Revenge spread out its hands and gave her tongue.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of 'The School for Scandal,' Miss Knickerbocker?" she asked,
wreathing her face in an inscrutable smile.</p>

<p>Glad of an opportunity for displaying her knowledge, Georgina rose eagerly to the
bait. "I saw the play at the Park in the twenties. 'Twas a prodigious fine cast, if I
remember."</p>

<p>"They say a new Sheridan has

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>

come to our city." Every Gothamite loved that phrase, "our city," and Mrs. Snograss
dwelt on the words with the nicest shade of mimicry. "He is preparing a little comedy I
might dub the same name," she snickered.</p>

<p>"An author man?" asked the Knickerbocker voice that always filled the room. "What
does he want here?"</p>

<p>A sudden silence fell upon the company. Eyes were turned on the Turkey carpet before
the fireplace where the great ladies stood. Ears were cocked in their direction. The
pirouetting woodland fay embellishing the tambour firescreen, worked by the Trentonian

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

when she attended Madame de Foe's Academy for gentle children, wore a more conscious
smirk than usual. Even the twin Bow dogs which had held their tufted tails erect through
the stormiest family fracases seemed agitated.</p>

<p>"He plays the organ at our church," she answered with forced deliberation; then in a
whisper loud enough to have done credit to a lady on the boards, she added, "and when
away from that instrument spends his time making love to your niece Patricia."</p>

<p>Mrs. Snograss gave a hysterical laugh and retreated a few rods.</p>

<p>A thunder-bolt falling at Miss

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

Georgina's feet could not have created more consternation. For a moment she glared at
the creature before her as if she were a butterfly or a beetle&mdash;something to be
crushed and killed&mdash;then remembering that politeness is always a trusty weapon, she
roared in as soft a fashion as she could, "You are mistaken, madam!"</p>

<p>"My Julie saw them kissing less than an hour ago on the Marine Parade!"</p>

<p>"Ladies who make confidants of their servants are often misinformed," the other
hissed.</p>

<p>By this time all Vesey Street was on its feet. The plans of the day were forgotten.
Every one

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>

was too stunned to speak. A Knickerbocker openly insulted&mdash;the thought was
appalling! Miss Julie, who was fingering some Snograss ambrotypes, let them slip to the
floor in her excitement. She had not been so much agitated for years&mdash;not since a
certain ship sailed out of Amboy for the Indies bearing a youthful captain whom Judge
Knickerbocker had bidden her forget.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" she gasped&mdash;and there were those who afterward declared she looked
almost pleased. "My niece has a lover!" But in another breath, "Oh, what will her father
say?"</p>

<p>"Jerusalem, restrain yourself," called her sister. That lady was sweeping proudly
from the room.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Impudence!" she said, thrusting her sister out of the hall. When the cold air of the
street touched their hot faces, she spoke again. Her anger was fast engulfed in a wave
of bitter humiliation.</p>

<p>"We are disgraced, Jerusalem! The Knickerbocker name dishonored! The man is a person
of common family. I fear the Gobies and the Gabies are turning in their graves. What
would Aunt Jane have thought?"</p>

<p>"They kissed in the shrubbery&mdash;My niece in love?" Miss Julie was whispering to
herself unheeded.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

The faded leaves of the one flower in her heart were stirring gently.</p>

<p>Now and then the faint note of a bell drifted on the air. The old sexton of St.
Paul's was preparing his metal children for their long anthem.</p>

<p>"Oh, joyous night, make haste&mdash;make haste," they tinkled to the taper-like star
above them.</p>

<p>"Disgraced!" muttered Miss Georgina.</p>

<p class="dropcap">he glimmering lantern which the serving-maid Betty carried seemed like a huge firefly
come back to a land of blooms. Sometimes in dim alleyways it caught in her flapping
garments, and her two mistresses were forced to cling together until they reached the
next patch of moonlight. When

<span class="pagenum" style="text-indent: 0em;"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>

their half-tasted dinner was finished, and the silver counted and locked in the cherry
cabinet, Georgina commanded her sister to step over with her to the mansion. Jonathan
never permitted the family vehicle to be brought out when the world was not looking, and
his womenkind were used to tramping through the darkness. Julie was reluctant to go at
first, but the other's anger flamed so high she could not help catching some of the
sparks.</p>

<p>"Would you allow your niece to ruin her life by marrying a man who gains his
livelihood playing a musical instrument? Methinks you have a fondness for hornpipers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>

and such. There was Signor Succhi, our dancing-master, I recollect"&mdash;nodding her
head&mdash;"he used to call you 'little peach-blossom'&mdash;his little
peach-blossom!"</p>

<p>Julie smiled at Georgina's latest feat of memory; then she turned about and gazed
into the dying embers. For a moment she stood beside a merry-eyed youth who dared her to
prick the signor's silken calves. Did he really perfect their symmetry with cotton as
was said, she wondered? Alas, that she was born timorous.</p>

<p>"Are your wits leaving you, Jerusalem?" continued the other&mdash;"you who wear Aunt
Jane's hair locket and have been for years an

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

ornament in the highest sphere of this city&mdash;now being ruined by Trentonians and
other foreigners. Where is your boasted allegiance to those of your family who have gone
before you?"</p>

<p>Threatened and cajoled by turns Miss Julie was led into the night. "The Snograss
woman may have lied," came the consoling thought. She cheered herself with it hurrying
through the snow.</p>

<p>Up Church Street they stumbled past huts and houses. Warm windows beckoned to them.
Georgina had forgotten the mittens for her nieces. The scene at the Snograss House was
uppermost in her mind.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>

"What a sly minx Patricia is to have kept the disgraceful affair from us so long," she
was thinking. "Could that skulking Juma have helped her? He knew enough to bamboozle
one. There was a report that old Roberta Johnstone even read him novels." The boisterous
wind, tossing the budding lilac branches about the statues in the Knickerbocker garden
which the girl in the window-seat was watching, came shrieking out of unexpected
openings and buffeted her aunts in the face.</p>

<p>Now they were entering the narrow passage that opened into Vesey Street. The tavern
lights twinkled beyond, but drear and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>

lonely the artery for cut-throats appeared.</p>

<p>Georgina, brave and intrepid, was still nursing her wrath when a mist came before her
eyes. "I see! I feel queer!" she cried. Her companions were shaking like autumn leaves.
"Oh, don't pause, sister!" squeaked terrified Julie, "here's where that picaroon in the
black mask was wont to hide. A Dick Turpin may be concealed yonder!"</p>

<p>"Hist!" called Georgina, as if speaking to some vermin of the night. A shadowy
mocking face was rising up before her. She began to tremble&mdash;where had she seen it?
Yes, 'twas the face of the ancestress whose portrait Jonathan

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>

took down from the line of Knickerbockers in the parlor. "My nerves," she gasped. "Come,
let us haste, you trembling fools!" Once in the driveway to the house she denied her
fright. Betty was scolded for stumbling over a brier-bush. When the long flight of steps
was reached, she rushed at them boldly. "Knock, Jerusalem," she commanded.</p>

<div class="imgright" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/gs12.png" width="292" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The little woman tried to sound the clapper, then fell back exhausted. Georgina,
enraged, seized it and thumped violently upon the plate. The sounds reverberated through
the night, clashing against the bell-notes and the sound of the swaying elms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Jonathan and his daughters sprang from their seats. The Santa Cruz invoices slipped
to the floor and fluttered after the wool balls like merchants aspiring to new
possessions. What cared the horn of plenty on the door for the profits of the Fleet
Sally? It had watched the ebb and flow of lordlier fortunes. "That ear-splitting bell
hubbub&mdash;and now visitors," said the master, advancing to his offspring as if they
were the cause of this new annoyance.</p>

<p>Juma, already half-drunk with dreams, rubbed his dazed head and hastened toward the
entry. Was Toussaint calling him? Did the chair of Marie du Buc de Marcinelle,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>

the Elizabethtown beauty, pause before the hair-dresser's sign? Then time and place came
back. Realizing that he was watched, he drew the great bolt with a show of strength, and
in bounded the gale-blown humanity.</p>

<p>"You?" queried the head of the Knickerbockers. That was the only greeting he gave his
nearest relations on Easter eve. He glanced at Julie to see whether she secreted any
packages about her person.</p>

<p>Georgina, entering the room, her face stern and white, said, eyeing him, "Prepare
yourself for a shock."</p>

<p>He returned the challenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Had she been tampering with her five-per-cents for Peruvian investments? Was it the
old plaint&mdash;Jerusalem's frivolity? Why did the woman gaze at him so mournfully?</p>

<p>"Prepare yourself," she continued, her voice rising to a shriek. "Patricia&mdash;your
Patricia&mdash;has disgraced us!"</p>

<p>The girl peering from the landing heard her name called. Her secret was known to the
world and would soon be an implement

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

of torture. The arbutus fell from her bodice unheeded. She could not meet that cruel
group below!</p>

<p>"Richard," sighed the stray gusts of wind on the staircase; "Richard" chimed the
patient clock. She crept closer to the baluster railing. Some mysterious force was
guiding&mdash;impelling her onward. Out of the shadows flashed a face. Like a smile it
vanished. She ran to the steps. For a moment she stood silent, gaining courage to
descend.</p>

<hr style="width: 10%" />

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 220px;">
<img src="images/gs13.png" width="220" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>At the very moment when she had glanced back tremblingly for a parting benediction
from the stars, a figure wrapped in a great-coat

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>

was hurrying out of the Sheridan garden. It was Patricia's lover. The youth often came
to gaze at her home after sleep locked all the doors of the world but the dream door for
which he had never yet found a key. Then the daytime's barriers were broken and she was
his alone. Under the Knickerbocker elm-trees he would stand, sometimes, a wild,
impassioned troubadour, aflame with songs of love for his imprisoned mate. Again she
came to him a vision pure and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

ethereal and he folded her to his heart in memory of one perfect Junetime
day&mdash;while multitudes of roses shed their fragrant petals and birds trilled a
divine chorus. To-night, with the wondrous Easter peace upon him, she seemed to walk by
his side. Those bell-notes drifting on the air were the music of their lives. Hand in
hand they floated on the flow of the darkness. Through the days&mdash;and the years.
Through the springs&mdash;and the summers. Always together! Little forms clutched their
knees. Carking care crept out of black coverts. Death beckoned to them in the
distance&mdash;still, there was the scent of Junetime

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>

roses. Ah, God! those roses of love, they were theirs for all eternity!</p>

<p>As he neared Knickerbocker Mansion his mood changed. The bells were dying away again.
Old Jenkins up in the steeple above the lights of the drowsy city was letting his metal
children rest. Their task would soon be over, for the faithful moss-hung clock already
pointed to the nightcap hour. The rushes in the poorer regions near the waste lands were
flickering out&mdash;only the gentry street was still aglow.</p>

<p>A flock of snow-sparrows caught by the gale dashed past the youth, chattering bird
imprecations. Beyond,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>

in the moonlight, loomed Her dwelling-place. Coldly white and dreary it looked.
Everything about it was mute and unaware of the joyous night. Did Juma keep his promise
and give her the arbutus? A longing thrilled him to know her thoughts at this hour. Were
they of him? He hastened into the carriage-path, following the footprints made by the
trio from Goby House. The leaden statues leered at him in the spaces between the
evergreens. Bare shrubs sighed their gusty dirges at his heels.</p>

<p>At the lordly flight of steps he paused and hesitated. Then her pleading voice seemed
to rise on

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

the wind. A strange intuition swayed him. The great door of the mansion was moving,
opening inward. He asked himself if he were going stark mad, as he crept to it softly,
like a thief.</p>

<p>A cry met his ears, and he staggered back&mdash;"I love him! I shall love him
always!" came the words.</p>

<p>"Patricia," he whispered breathlessly.</p>

<p>Before him was the dismal length of the hall that he had never hoped to enter. Slowly
he reeled forward.</p>

<hr style="width:10%" />

<p>While her lover was coming to her through the night, the girl

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

was descending the staircase. At the bottom she paused and remained very still. From the
room beyond an army of candle rays was slipping underneath the green sarcenet curtain
and capering gnome-like about her feet. They were waiting for her in there! A prowling
rat scampered down the dark passage. In another moment she would stand before her
indignant family. The curtain shifted and shadows chased away the light. Behind the
awful thing were their watchful eyes. She began to tremble and stretch out her hands
imploringly at the space before it. The courage that had brought her so near to the
chamber of judgment

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>

was fast vanishing when Juma came slowly out of the pantry. He did not speak, but his
sad old eyes rested on her lovingly. Stifled sobs shook her slender frame as she nestled
close to him, seeking the help that he was powerless to give. A wilder gust of wind blew
the neglected spray of arbutus from the landing above and it fell at her feet like a
message. She looked at it a moment, then slowly parted the veil of the inevitable. The
eyes she feared were now upon her.</p>

<p>Jonathan, choleric with indignation, stood by his desk, clenching his hands. At the
sight of the child whose conduct swept aside

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>

every Knickerbocker law his rage overflowed, and the room was full of a torrent of
reproaches. Once he came near knocking over a bust of Mr. Washington, the property of a
Makemie, and Miss Julie gave a slight scream.</p>

<p>Patricia heard him silently. She was calmer than any of the spectators. The other
Mansion girls continually slid off their chairs and made weird gurgles with their
throats. Several times they almost interrupted their parent. As for Georgina, her
high-built hair shook like a barrister's wig in the heat of a court appeal.</p>

<p>"You have disgraced us&mdash;a common follower fit for a tire-woman!

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>

Yes, miss, in your veins flows the Knickerbocker blood, though I cannot credit it. Say
'tis a lie ere I turn you out. Say 'tis the fabrication of that catamount Trenton woman,
envious of your aunts' reputation. Speak, girl! Is it true that the town has seen you
keeping trysts with him at the Battery? Speak!" gasped the worthy man.</p>

<p>"It is true," said Patricia, trying to keep herself strong for battle.</p>

<p>The draught from the half opened door, which Juma in his excitement had neglected to
shut, swept the chimney piece and ended the life of a candle.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Jonathan dragging his daughter by the arms, and pointing

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

to the portraits along the wall. "You are the first to disgrace them! They were as fine
a line of men and women as was ever bred up in America. Think you they stepped down from
their high places for silly fancies? Think you they forgot they were born to superior
circumstances and sullied their reputations?"</p>

<p>Here the autocrat of York's voice broke slightly. The same ghostly face that had
appeared to Miss Georgina in Cut-throat Alley leered at him suddenly, and he recoiled.
Aghast, he remembered the painting under the attic eaves!</p>

<p>Patricia was facing him. The word love was in his ears. With

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>

a maddened cry he advanced quivering. Along the films of the air he saw his ancestors
as he often pictured them to himself&mdash;a fine mass of superior clay on a
pedestal.</p>

<p>"You shall give him up!" he thundered. Then he turned. The green sarcenet curtain
moved ominously, and the form of Richard Sheridan was disclosed in its folds.</p>

<p>The youth, heedless of the frowning faces about him, gazed only at the woman he was
ready to die for if need were. The passions of the world were swept away as the echo of
her cry "I love him&mdash;I shall love him always!"&mdash;bounded through his heart. For
one harmonious moment they gazed into

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>

each other's eyes forgetful of surging discords. With stronger grip he clutched at the
curtain!</p>

<p>"You, sirrah!" scoffed the voice Patricia thought would go on forever, inflicting
fresh wounds at each new outburst. "Impudent organ thumper&mdash;to dare come here! I'll
better your judgment." As he moved nearer Richard she thrust herself before him.</p>

<p>From the corner of the room came a wail from Julie. "Oh, don't be hard on them,
Jonathan. You helped father make me give up Captain MacLeerie," she faltered. "I might
have been Mrs. Captain MacLeerie! Poor Bodsey&mdash;he vowed he'd never sail a ship

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>

into Amboy Harbor again&mdash;and perhaps the cannibals have him now, or the devil
fishes!"</p>

<p>She began to weep softly. Outside a heavy oaken shutter clanked against the house.
Patricia threw her arms about her lover's neck, and her father gazed at her spellbound
with fury.</p>

<p>"Disgraced us, hussy," he muttered. "Go with your tinker!"</p>

<p>Juma fell on his knees and began to lament after the fashion of his kind.</p>

<p>"Begone!"&mdash;spoke the voice again, breaking at last&mdash;"You are no longer one
of us!"</p>

<p>The girl, supported by the man to whom she was giving her young

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>

life, and followed by the trembling negro, crept slowly away.</p>

<p>Whiffs of air increasing to a current swept from out the hall. The remaining lights
fought with it&mdash;then despaired. A tired moon was slumbering behind the western
pines, and only the glow of a few watchful stars dripped through the casements.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the breaths of every one in the room came faster and faster. Vapors
wan and tinged with dust filled the atmosphere, and an unmistakable odor of sandal-wood,
faint from long imprisonment.</p>

<p>The startled Knickerbockers retreated to the walls, knocking over

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>

chairs and tables in their flight. Before the green sarcenet curtain which had played
such a part in the affairs of the night there was a waft of airy garments. A white weft
of towering hair&mdash;black, burning eyes. Three Knickerbockers knew them! The lady of
the banished portrait was moving through the doorway and speaking in quaint last-century
utterance.</p>

<p>"Come back!" she called to the lovers, speaking to Patricia. "'Tis a weary while I
have been in the other world, but your sore need has brought me here on the anniversary
of the birth of love. I am your great-great-grandmother, who felt the full force of the
pretty passion and stole away with my dear heart from yonder theatre in old John
Street&mdash;a grain house in your time, so one from York who recently joined us
informed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Although my likeness does not hang in the family line, I bear you small malice. I
get a surfeit of their society." Here the ghost sighed, and with the saddest air
possible tapped her empty snuffbox and went through the act of inhaling a reviving pinch
of strong Spanish. "This girl who has the bloom of me I would befriend, and as the
greatness of your ancestors is all that stands in the way of a marriage with the man of
her choice, I have bid them come to meet

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>

you and get their opinions, mayhap."</p>

<p>A tremor went through the room! More unearthly visitants? The flesh was creeping on
the bones of all the living Knickerbockers!</p>

<p>"They are waiting for us in Lady Knickerbocker's state-room yonder&mdash;Sir William
tried to kiss me there once after a junket," she continued. "He would not come
to-night&mdash;I fear he was afraid it would be dull."</p>

<p>She moved over to Jonathan, who was speechless from fright, and laid a shadowy hand
on his. Once past the door ledge she began the descent of the hall as if footing the air
of some ancient melody.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>

With grim, rebellious face the present head of her house moved with her, apparently
against his own volition.</p>

<p>By the one brightly floriated mirror she straightened her osprey plumes and tapped
him gently with her fan. "You dance like a footman," she said. "Have you go-carts 'neath
your feet?"</p>

<p>The trembling file of Knickerbockers followed after them, seemingly blown by the
wind, whose diabolical wailing reverberated through the house. Doors and windows raged
and rattled. There were stridulous, uncanny groans from quaking beams. Behind the panels
adown the hall rose and swelled

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>

the confused murmur of many voices. The echoes of long dead years were reviving. Above
them all was a dying requiem of bells, tolling low and mournfully like a warning to
belated road-farers that the ghosts of the haughty Knickerbockers were seeking earth
again.</p>

<p>s the family neared the long unused state parlor the din grew louder&mdash;a rising
treble of voices, ascending from hoarse trumpet tones to a twittering falsetto,
accompanied by a maddening persistent tapping of high heels on the smooth floor. The
sounds of shivering glass as a girandole crashed from its joining met their ears. Each
second was

<span class="pagenum" style="text-indent:0em;"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>

a discord running wild with panic-striking incidents.</p>

<p>Julie grasped frantically at the more stalwart Georgina, while clinging to her own
garments were the three Mansion girls, screeching like the town's whistles in a March
twilight.</p>

<p>The ghost little Jerusalem feared the most was that of the stern Judge. "Will he know
that I have changed my name?" she wailed. "Oh, sister, I ate up those bracelets he gave
me for taking treacle. I sold them to a silversmith and bought French prunes. You know
you said that you'd as soon eat stewed bull-frogs as anything grown by the Monsieurs,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>

and all York was stewing prunes!"</p>

<p>Georgina never turned her head at this remarkable confession. Her features had
assumed a strange rigidity; she was as silent as her brother. The shrieks of her nieces,
old Juma's incessant lamentations, and the low whispers of the lovers were all unheeded.
The racket behind the cobwebbed doors, never opened but for Knickerbocker weddings and
funerals, absorbed her senses. Slowly they were swinging back for Jonathan and his
phantom partner. The delicate odor of sandal-wood, was strengthened by gasps of musk.
Into a yellow blinding glare of light the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>

file of Knickerbockers looked, and their eyes grew gooseberry-like with horror.</p>

<p>A crowd of shades bedecked in their last earthly garniture were gliding and teetering
about; some dignified as at a stately farce, others hilarious with ungraceful
levity.</p>

<p>As the living Knickerbockers appeared in the room the waggling and chortling fell
into a monotone, and the company began to pass in review before them, seemingly desirous
of attracting individual notice. Few wore the costly attire one would have expected from
the tales spread about them by the Knickerbockers of Vesey Street. Several were clad in
plain humhums

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>

and torn fustians. One chirpy dame in a moth-eaten tabby hugged a little package of
Bohea to her stomacher, unmindful of the fact that the luxury had grown much cheaper
since she quitted this sphere. Another, who evidently thought herself a beauty, wore a
false frontage of goat hair before her muslin cap, and ogled Jonathan as she passed,
though he did not seem eager for a flirtation with his ugly great-aunt.</p>

<p>An ungainly yokel stepped on the feet of the Mansion girls, and some bold gentlemen,
who had spent a goodly portion of their natural lives in Bridewell, swore at them. Still
the awful procession

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>

kept moving on&mdash;faces were as thick as the tapers glowing in every bracket and
candelabra. Bursts of music rose on the wind&mdash;a wheezing tune that sobbed of past
jubilation. Suddenly all the Knickerbockers gasped. Stern Judge Knickerbocker, who had
rarely smiled in life, was seen advancing, bent double with laughter and clinging to a
figure in a cardinal hoop.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us cover our eyes," whispered Miss Georgina. "This is more than I can
bear."</p>

<p>"Don't!" said the lady of the banished portrait. "You have often boasted of your
family's intimacy with that queer figure.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

Through your veneration of him, York has made him into quite a hero. It is the friend of
one of the first American Knickerbockers&mdash;Lord Cornbury! He was addicted to wearing
women's furbelows!"</p>

<p>"Gazooks!" exclaimed his Lordship, in a tone loud enough for the Knickerbockers to
hear. "More of those tiresome impertinents! The next thing the whole of the presumptuous
clan will be petitioning me for standing room at my routs."</p>

<p>"Don't go any nearer to them," said the Judge, in the tones of a sycophant. "If they
bore you, my dear Corny, I am willing to cut them. <em>You know it is the fashion on
earth to recognize only the most</em>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>

<em>desirable</em> ancestors, and we can return the compliment. Besides it was decreed
that I should be jocular for the next half century, and I'm afraid a too close
inspection would cause me to don weepers."</p>

<p>The group by the doors felt a sickening sensation in their flaccid frames. Jonathan's
partner, knowing how grievously they must all have been affected by the change in their
parent, turned her head.</p>

<p>A one-eyed hag was advancing to her. She curtsied low, and presented two bits of
plaster which had fallen from the ceiling.</p>

<p>"Messages," she snickered, fumbling with her hands.</p>

<p>"From Marmaduke and Leonidas

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

Barula," read the lady (though no one knows how, for she only observed the niches). "We
beg to be excused from coming to-night. To put it mildly, we were raised aloft in Pearl
Street Hollow for practising target shooting on coach-drivers, and our necks are still
out of joint and not fit to be seen in company."</p>

<p>As the merriment waxed louder a Gobie, who had spent her life as a fish-fag, began
tapping on the panelled wainscot. With a hoarse guffaw she turned her piercing alaquine
eyes on Miss Julie and squinted&mdash;"More negus! More here, you slubber-degullions. We
Gobies has a thirst. 'Twas what we were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

noted for in life&mdash;not our learning, great-niece," she mocked, as she turned her
head and grimaced at Miss Georgina.</p>

<p>"Go away!" snuffled that once resolute woman, too weak to combat any longer. A
feeling of despair was settling upon her like a pall. What if Mrs. Rumbell, or, worse
still, if Mrs. Snograss should be passing Knickerbocker House and hear the oaths and
ungenteel voices of the supposedly elegant family? No tap-room fracas at Fraunces' could
have equalled the deafening hubbub.</p>

<p>"Beshrew the old fool, she be as jealous for the lies she told of us as a Barbary
pigeon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go away!" continued the sinking sister of the autocrat of York.</p>

<p>That distraught-looking gentleman himself was hastening across the room with
restorative salts, which one of his daughters always carried in her reticule. As he
approached Georgina the Gobie snatched the bottle from his hand and drained it at a
gulp.</p>

<p>"Anything with fire-water for me," she hiccoughed. Then clutching hold of him, she
sunk her voice to a whisper&mdash;"I left this sphere for drinking a quart of
gillyflower scent!"</p>

<p>Julie began to weep softly&mdash;"Oh, Aunt Jane, if you were only here! Our Aunt Jane
was different

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>

from these people," she wailed to herself, half apologetically.</p>

<p>She was fond of studying the picture in the other room and could have traced it from
memory. Raising her eyes, she gave a prolonged shriek. The fish-fag and some of the
Makemies were dragging her beloved Jane over Lady Lyron's court steps, out of the
powdering closet.</p>

<p>The room was becoming uproarious. Doors were opening and shutting again, letting in
the moaning of the bells. The culmination of the buffoonery was approaching.</p>

<p>"Good, Jane," sobbed Miss Julie.</p>

<p>"Good, Jane," echoed the chorus of the spectres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Reluctant, and feigning a great stress of emotion, the poor lady was pushed into the
illuminated space below the hundred-taper drop. She looked like some pretty long-vaulted
effigy. In her hands she still carried the spray of milk-weed.</p>

<p>The noise lessened for a moment. Jane gazed reproachfully at her niece, Julie, as if
the indiscreet wish were the cause of her present misery, and said, in a pensive voice,
"I did not want to come to-night."</p>

<p>"I always knew you were a modest woman," said Jonathan, recovering a little of his
once audacious manner.</p>

<p>"Modest forsooth!" giggled the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

fish-fag diabolically, and seizing one of Jonathan's fat hands in her bony fingers, she
drew it over the other's face.</p>

<p>"Look, see the white streaks on her now! She reddened, the hussy,&mdash;or I'm not a
Gobie!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was vain," answered the most prated-about of female Knickerbockers. "I used
countless beautifiers&mdash;pearl powders, cherry salve, cupid's tints. Everything Mr.
Gaine sold at the Crown. They hooked the men. When pearl powders came upon the market, I
received three offers&mdash;Jenks&mdash;a tutor at King's College&mdash;not the
President, as the report remains on earth&mdash;wrote me a poem in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>

<em>Weekly Gossiper</em>, called 'Pink and White Amanda.'"</p>

<p>"Jane Knickerbocker," said the ghost who was giving the party, "your family has spent
many hours telling the present generation of your womanly virtues, and they cannot fail
in having an overweening respect for any opinion you may utter. Shall this girl who
bears your blood marry yon youth?"</p>

<p>"Let them wed by all means, if they see advantage in it. I vow if I could come back
to earth and live my twenty-eight years over again, I would join hands with Jean, our
Elizabeth-Town perfumer."</p>

<p>Lord Cornbury and the shades about him were bowed with mirth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Janet, you giddy girl, though half the age of most of us, I protest you are becoming
a wit. You will be getting into society next," he cried. "I shall never be mean enough
to tell that in sublunary times one of the first American Knickerbockers knew me
intimately only as my valet."</p>

<p>"A fig for your class distinctions," called the fair indignant, hunting for a rouge
rag. "Years ago we heard ''twas money made the court circle at York.' Why, you must
remember how you feared your creditors when they first came below."</p>

<p>"Alack, indeed," said his Lordship plaintively, "this hooped petticoat was never paid
for."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>After dishevelled Jane had vanished again into the powdering closet whence she had
first emerged, the lady of the banished portrait moved over to Patricia and her lover.
Standing side by side the resemblance between the two women was remarkable. One was the
budding flower; the other the fragile shadow of a beautiful life.</p>

<p>"Her kind will always exist," she said. "They marry for pearl powders and other
vanities, and usually seek, or are forced into, a gilded cage. There, like jackdaws,
they call out their possessions from dawn till night, and the heedless world passing by
sees the sparkling of the gold, mistakes the caws for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

singing, and applauds. I knew love&mdash;the ideal love that smiles at one from the
wayside when one is seeking it in the well-kept gardens. I paid for it with my heart's
blood, and I never had cause to regret. Over the rough places of my earthly journey it
followed me with radiant illusions. The April winds were sweeter, the sunshine on the
roads warmer. I felt all the raptures mother nature gives her children. That is why I
could leave the other world to do you this service. <em>Love</em> is the one thing death
cannot lull to sleep!"</p>

<p>Patricia tried to answer, but the power of speech had left her for the moment. Juma's
face was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

glowing with peaceful smiles. He bent low on his right knee to kiss the diaphanous
draperies of the shade.</p>

<p>Outside in the night there arose the low murmurous chanting of the town waits moving
homeward. A chime of bells, as soft as a blessing. The thorns had fallen from the brows
of love.</p>

<p>While Patricia's benefactress gave her message the circle of ghosts was making way
for the other Knickerbockers to enter. On closer inspection, many of them proved to be
tame sort of animals enough. From a distance one monster of a woman had given the
impression that she was trying to bully posterity. Perhaps this was due to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>

the long feathers in her head-dress, that nodded maliciously at her most placid motion.
As she bowed to her descendants a plume tickled the tip of Jonathan's nose and he jumped
back slightly. "I am Melodia Mudford Makemie," she said, "and I thought you would like
to meet me, as I started the Christmas fashion of giving hot-bag covers in York."</p>

<p>"Hot-bag covers!" reiterated Miss Georgina, astonished. "I have always said mittens.
Why, in my ancestry book it is noted that in the year 1768 you gave one hundred pairs of
silk mittens to Gruel Hall, the home for tiresome gentlewomen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"The years play great hoaxes," chuckled the ghost. "Those ancestry books are a
standard joke with us, and I believe they are looked upon with some suspicion in your
own world."</p>

<p>Melodia seemed so friendly, Julie gained courage enough to purse up her lips for a
speech, but the shade anticipated her.</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to ask&mdash;why did I make such a wide frill about the
bottle's neck? 'Tis easy to explain. I never took my bag to church to warm my
hands&mdash;'twas my stomach!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Julie, faltering slightly, fearing that this relative might become
vulgar like the terrible

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

Gobies still dancing about Lord Cornbury.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the other, "when William fell asleep during the sermon I used to
sink down well in the pew, put the frill up to my mouth, squeeze the end of the bag, and
get as much as a dram of whiskey."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Julie, aghast; "a hot-water bag for whiskey!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the ghost, angrily. Her manner was that of one who had expected
commendation for her cleverness. The plumes in her head-dress were shaking
violently.</p>

<p>"Why not, miss?" she asked again. "You are far too nice.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

At any rate you know the reason for those tomfool bag-covers. 'Twas to deaden the smell
of liquor. Your generation of Yorkers does not appreciate them as we did." Then her
voice broke into derisive sniggers, as she glided away.</p>

<p>And now upon the strange company fell the bellowing of some faithful passing
watchman.</p>

<p>"Midnight's here and fair weather!"</p>

<p>A sleepy cock crowed in a distant Chelsea barn.</p>

<p>The faces of the shades began to blanch and assume the lack-lustre tint of ashes. The
lady of the banished portrait touched Patricia as if giving her a last embrace, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>

her smile at Richard Sheridan was full of good wishes.</p>

<p>"Do you consent to the marriage," she whispered, bending over Jonathan, "or shall we
come to-morrow night?"</p>

<p>"I do," he answered hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Then we go in peace," sighed the ghost.</p>

<p>There was a flutter of garments and the lights vanished suddenly. Only the scents of
old-time perfumes remained, sweet as the hearts of vanished roses.</p>

<p>A cackle of feeble laughter floated back to the room as if the departing
Knickerbockers were still making merry on the stairway to the other world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The song of the weary bells was over. Peace had fallen upon the earth, and in Lady
Tyron's mouldering parlor the vials of a foolish pride were despoiled forever. Through
the mystical light the living of the family seemed to be strangely transfigured.
Jonathan Knickerbocker, the autocrat of York, walked with his head bowed upon his
breast. The hard lineaments of Georgina's face were softened. Ofttimes she turned
uneasily, half expecting some awful apparition to emerge before her. As for Miss Julie,
she moved like one in a dreamland of her own. The tears of the night had fallen upon
that little flower in her heart

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

and brought it back to life. Henceforth it would fill all her remaining years with
fragrance. The three eldest Knickerbocker daughters clung to her as if she were the
guiding light of their starved souls.</p>

<p>Suddenly she left them, and went to her brother.</p>

<p>"I am glad they came, Jonathan," she faltered; "we had forgotten God made us all in
His own image. He gave us the flowers and the stars, the sweet winds and the
spring-times&mdash;the voices of children and the songs of birds. Every man is rich if
he but knew it, and those who are only rich in pride are the poorest of the race."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Over by the shimmering casement, the youth and the girl crept nearer to each other.
Softly he drew her to him until her face was close to his. The night was dead. Down old
Broadway, over the Bowling Green, the Easter dawn tiptoed into the silent city.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
